assumptions:
distribution of promoted posts is similar to regular posts
notes are generally negative for the externality
misleading categories
externality of worst posts is $1.53 (Goldstein 2014)

calculations:
v = random cost * actions then divide by impressions/1000
e = value from -3 to 3 from note type - 0-1 from average note rating
	divide by 4 to bring magnitude to 0-1 and multiply by 1.53

1) figure out if there is a good theoretical distribution to fit to the data
2) add optimization algorithm to find some empirical tau start with affine functions
3) impression counts per time value day
4) make parameter for ratio of value to advertisers to externality (e.g. 1=equal value),
	return to -1to1 ranges and then scale using parameter


estimate user surplus from the externality
estimate producer surplus
can we transfer surplus from producer to user using mechanism
    this makes a 'fairer' system
can we increase participation rates by reducing annoyance
    this makes a 'better' system = more overall welfare
    can we estimate increased participation rates from the goldstein paper more?
